# Google Sign In Example

This Flutter example project shows how to use the
[google_sign_in Dart package](https://github.com/flutter/google-sign-in).

To run the example, type ```flutter run```. (You may need to update the path
to flutter in pubspec.yaml.)

Note: The Google Sign-In SDK is currently only supported on iOS. Android support
is coming soon!
